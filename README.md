# -Weather-Dashboard

The Weather Dashboard is a web application that allows users to search for and view current and future weather conditions for multiple cities. The application retrieves weather data from the OpenWeather API and dynamically updates the HTML and CSS to display the information.

## User Story
AS A traveler  
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities  
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

## Acceptance Criteria
- **Search Functionality**: Given a weather dashboard with form inputs, when I search for a city, I am presented with current and future conditions for that city, and that city is added to the search history.
- **Current Weather Conditions**: When I view current weather conditions for that city, I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed.
- **Future Weather Conditions**: When I view future weather conditions for that city, I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.
- **Search History**: When I click on a city in the search history, I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city.
